# joshi

`joshi` is JavaScript Shell Script Interpreter

> Think of it as something similar to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) but with a
> different API, JavaScript engine (`joshi` uses 
> [Duktape](https://duktape.org/) instead of 
> [V8](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-v8-javascript-engine)), and aiming at a
> different goal.

## Comparison to Node.js or similar tools

### Why should I use joshi instead of Node.js

The main reasons why I created `joshi` are:

1. It is by far much simpler than `Node.js`: this is because `Duktape` is just
   one C file implementing the whole JavaScript engine.
2. It is implemented with (almost) no dependencies: currently only `glibc`,
   `libxcrypt` and, optionally, `ncurses` are needed.
3. The API is designed to expose `POSIX`/`Linux` APIs: if you know how to use
   `POSIX` APIs, you know how to use `joshi`.
4. The programming model is not asynchronous: we use the old `fork` process
   model (we don't even have/need threads yet).
5. Exposing a native API is as easy as creating a JSON file and running
   `joshpec`: this tool generates a stub so that you can call C functions from
   JavaScript.
6. It is very lightweight: because the core of `joshi` is `Duktape` and it's
   optimized for small systems, `joshi` is very lightweight, with a reasonable 
   performance.

### Why shouldn't I use joshi

Because `joshi` is something new you should not expect a lot of support or
goodies from the community.

Also, it is important to keep in mind that `joshi` is targeting `Linux` systems
(and especially [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/)) for developing terminal
tools or daemons.

So, don't create web servers or any other performance critical tool with it!

Finally, `Duktape` only supports `ECMAScript 5`, however there are plans to 
support `ECMAScript 6+` in the future. But for now, if you want to use
`ECMAScript 6+`, `TypeScript`, or similar languages, you need to transpile and
face the sadness of having to build, package and map (by hand, because `joshi`
does NOT support sourcemaps) the source lines of your code.

## How to install

For now, `joshi` can only be automatically installed in `ArchLinux`, using the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

This Git repository is itself an AUR repository, so you just need to clone it 
and follow the steps
[described in ArchLinux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository)
to install it.

## How to build the project

The project is easy to build. It has a C based part that must be compiled with
`gcc` and the rest is plain JavaScript. Even though the C part depends on the 
platform, the small set of dependencies needed makes it highly portable (as long
as it is compiled in a `POSIX`/`Linux` system).

For the time being it is not prepared to be compiled in `Windows` or `Mac`. In
theory it should be easy to port, but I don't need it and I find that the
JavaScript APIs could look unnatural in non-Linux systems (and especially in 
Windows). However, the project is open to contribution for ports if someone
finds it useful.

### Building the binary

The steps are quite easy. All you need is `make`, `gcc`, and two or three more
dependencies (you can see the list in the 
[PKGBUILD file](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/blob/master/PKGBUILD), section
`makedepends`).

Once everything is installed, head up to the
[src directory](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/tree/master/src) and simply run
`make`.

That will invoke the `all` target of
[Makefile](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/blob/master/src/Makefile) which, in 
turn, will build the binaries and create the docs.

Once the process is finished, you will have a complete runnable installation of
`joshi` in the
[dist folder](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/tree/master/src/dist) of the
project.

You can run `joshi` from there if you want. All you need to do is to export an
environment variable with the name `JOSHI_LIB_DIR` pointing to the 
[dist/usr/lib/joshi directory](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/tree/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi)
and then invoke the `joshi` binary (built when running `make`) at
`dist/usr/bin`.

Another alternative is to install it to your `ArchLinux` as explained in the 
previous section.

### Makefile targets

Currently, the
[Makefile](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/blob/master/src/Makefile) understands
the following targets:

1. `all`: builds everything (binaries and docs)
2. `ci`: same as all, and tests the package
3. `clean`: removes generated files from the source tree
4. `docs`: builds the docs
5. `test`: runs the tests (without building first)

### Used tools

As explained above, the project uses `gcc` to compile the C files. 

The project also needs to download [docdash](https://github.com/clenemt/docdash)
to create the docs and [Duktape](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape) for the
JavaScript engine.

These two downloads are completely automated using `curl`.

## Support

In a nutshell: there's no support Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

I develop this project for my own needs and in my spare time, so don't expect me
to fix any of your issues under any SLA.

If you find a bug, feel free to use the 
[Issues tab](https://github.com/izaera/joshi/issues) of the project so that I
can hint you on how to fix it (or maybe even fix it if I have the time ðŸ˜€).

If you fix the bug, feel free to send a pull request so that I can merge.

If you need a new feature and want to send a pull request for it, file an issue 
first to see if it fits. Beware that I want to keep the tool simple and very 
opinionated on what is implemented and what isn't, being **simplicity and lack
of dependencies** the main mantra, so don't get too fancy ðŸ˜….

In any case, `joshi` provides support for invoking any shared library (`.so` 
files) so there's nothing you can't do even if the core of the product doesn't 
allow it.

## Documentation

The project uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to generate its documentation. 

> ðŸ“š Browse the documentation at the
> [project's site](https://izaera.github.io/joshi)

The
API is divided in packages, like `fs`, `io`, `proc`, etc. 

> The whole list of packages is [here](./tree/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi).

The scope of each package should -hopefully- be clear given its name, and the 
functions inside it too. 

Because all packages resemble `POSIX` APIs, they don't declare classes, only 
functions and, sometimes, data structures based on JavaScript objects.

There are exceptions though: 

1. The [wui](./tree/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi/wui) package is dedicated to
   widget-oriented text user interfaces, so it declares widget classes. This is
   because object orientation is a quite convenient programming model for user
   interfaces.
2. The [shell](./tree/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi/shell) and 
   [perf](./tree/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi/perf) packages return some
   objects that implement specific interfaces. That is, even if the API is
   purely function-based, some of the return values of those functions are 
   object oriented.

## Examples

There are no examples available, but you can have a look at the
[tests](./tree/master/src/tests) and the 
[repl](./blob/master/src/dist/usr/lib/joshi/repl.js) module to see how the APIs
can be used.

If you implement anything using `joshi` that is worth making public, please file
an issue so that I can add it here.
